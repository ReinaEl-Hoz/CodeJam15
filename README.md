To run, create a .env file in the backend directory with the following format:
``` 
API_KEY=<your api key>
```

Then execute the following commands starting in the root directory:
```
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

cd ../frontend/data-chat
npm install
npm run dev
```
It is recommended to create a venv in the backend directory before installing requirements.
